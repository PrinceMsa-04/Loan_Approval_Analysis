# Loan Portfolio Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis of 500 defaulted loans to identify risk patterns and develop prevention strategies. This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis from SQL querying to interactive dashboard development.

## Key Findings

### High-Risk Client Identification
- Low-income clients with credit scores <600 showed 85% faster default rates
- 45% of business loan defaults came from self-employed applicants
- 15% of clients never made a single payment

### Loan Performance Insights  
- Personal loans: Highest volume (145) and fastest default timeline
- Business loans: Largest financial impact ($45K average loss per loan)
- Payment patterns: 2+ missed payments = 85% default probability within 60 days

### Geographic Risk Patterns
- California & Texas: Highest default concentrations
- Florida & New York: Largest average outstanding amounts
- Clear state-based risk variations identified
